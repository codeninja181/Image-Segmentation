# Image Segmentation Project

## Overview
Image Segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The primary goal of this project is to simplify the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for image segmentation, featuring state-of-the-art deep learning models and an intuitive interface for users.

## Features
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes support for popular models such as U-Net, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLab.
- **Custom Model Training**: Train your own segmentation models using custom datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Automatically applies transformations like flipping, rotation, and scaling to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Supports metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Coefficient, and Pixel Accuracy.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Easily visualize segmentation results with overlays and boundary maps.
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda for managing dependencies
- GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended for faster processing)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment for the project.
3. Install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Download the pre-trained weights (if applicable) by following the instructions in the `weights/README.md` file.

## Usage

### 1. Segment an Image
Process a single image using the provided script and specify the input image, output path, and model type.

### 2. Train a Custom Model
Train a model on your dataset by specifying the data directory, model type, number of epochs, and batch size.

### 3. Evaluate a Model
Evaluate the performance of a trained model on a validation set using predefined metrics.

### 4. Visualize Results
Visualize segmentation results by loading an image and a trained model, generating overlays or boundary maps.

## Dataset
This project is compatible with popular datasets like COCO, Pascal VOC, and Cityscapes. You can also use custom datasets by following the format guidelines in `data/README.md`.

## Models Supported
1. **U-Net**: Ideal for biomedical image segmentation.
2. **Mask R-CNN**: Best suited for object instance segmentation.
3. **DeepLab**: Optimized for semantic segmentation in natural scenes.
